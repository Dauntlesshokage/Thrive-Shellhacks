                question: "What is an international student loan?",
                answer:"International student loans are a type of loan offered by private institutions designed to help international students pay for a US based education.  The loan can be used for all kinds of expenses related to getting an education like tuition, books, fees, meal plan, and board at an educational institution."

                question: "What are the requirements for an international student loan?",
                answer:"You must be accepted to a college or university in the US.  Lenders will also often require a VISA, proof of acceptance, and many lenders will require a cosigner."

                question: "Should I get an international student loan?",
                answer:"Loans are not free money, you have to pay back what you borrow with interest.  Because of that a loan should be the last resort for paying for an education.  Scholarships and grants would be the best options for paying for an education, but if you are unable to cover expenses with scholarships an international student loan may be your only option."

                id:"5",
                question: "What is a cosigner?",
                answer:"A cosigner is someone who is legally required to pay back the loan in case the borrower is incapable of paying back the loan.  Since a cosigner reduces the risk to the lender you are likely to get a lower interest rate.  Because of this the cosigner must have a good credit score as well as the means  and the willingness to pay back the loan."

            {
                id:"6",
                question: "Where can I find a cosigner?",
                answer:"Since a cosigner must have a good credit history and be a US citizen or permanent resident it may be difficult to find one.  It would be a good idea to find a family member (even extended) or friend who is willing to cosign a loan.  A cosigner must trust you will pay back the loan, because if you do not they have to pay it back."

            {
                id:"7",
                question: "What if I canâ€™t get a cosigner?",
                answer:"Look for a lender who gives loans without needing a cosigner.  Interest rates may be higher since the lender is taking a larger risk then giving a loan with a cosigner."
            },
            {
                id:"8",
                question: "How large of a loan can I take?",
                answer:"Any minimum and maximal loan amounts vary depending on the lender.  Lenders usually allow international students to borrow the total cost of an education after aid, grants, and scholarships are subtracted from the total borrowed amount.  To get the amount of money needed to pay for college after other funding contact the financial aid office of the institution you plan to attend.  Lenders may require the school certify the amount needed before giving a loan."
